// Memory: what a Bot keeps across all its conversations, as Markdown in the Agent
// Memory Repo format (github.com/AgentMemoryRepo/agentmemoryrepo): one entry per
// bullet line ending in `[key: value; …]` metadata, and a MEMORY.md entry point whose
// `## Index` links topic files as [[topic]].
//
//   <home>/memory/bots/<botId>/   a Bot's own MEMORY.md and topics
//   <home>/memory/team/           what every Bot reads
//   <home>/memory/journal.jsonl   every change, with the line before and after
//   <home>/memory/snapshots/      the memory section each Session froze
//   <home>/memory/summaries/      the memory panel's summary per Bot
//   <home>/memory/archive/        the memory of deleted Bots
//   <home>/memory/reviewed.json   how far the memory review has read each conversation
//
// Files change in place and the journal keeps what each change replaced, so history
// needs no git. Bots change memory through remember and forget, which enforce who may
// write where, the fixed sizes, and that no key is kept; the memory review after each
// turn, and the memory panel for the user, go through the same path. The review is
// what keeps memory from depending on a Bot deciding to call remember. Writes run one
// at a time, in the process that holds the team (store.js). Each Session freezes its
// memory section the first time it renders, so its prompt stays byte-stable and the
// provider's prefix cache holds; a fresh part, or a checkpoint (which breaks the cache
// anyway), freezes it anew.
